## &raquo; HTML TLDR

HTML is a markup language describing a hierarchy of nodes which can be rendered in a web browser.

Here's few HTML elements, each can have content and/or child elements:

```html
<header>
  Hello <strong>world!</strong>
</header>
<span>
  <button>Click me!</button>
</span>
```

This renders in a web browser like so:

## &raquo; CSS TLDR

CSS is a descriptive language defining "classes" which you can assign to HTML elements to describe how they should be rendered.

Add a class property to an HTML element:

```html
<button class="myButton">Click me!</button>
```

And add css class with that name in a css file:

```css
.myButton {
  background: #efefef;
  border: 1px solid gray;
  color: green;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: Menlo;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

When the button is rendered in web browser it looks like this:

## &raquo; JavaScript TLDR

JavaScript is a programming language with simple syntax, which can run in a web browser, embedded in software apps, iOS, in standalone desktop apps, and more. Here's some basic language:

```JS
//local variable
let name = "Marin"

//local array
let names = [name, "Peter", "John"]

//declare function
function double(num) {
  return num * 2
}

//declare a class
class Hero extends Character {
  constructor(myType) {
    this.type = myType
  }
  
  getType() {
    return "is "+this.type
  }
}

//create object, call method
let me = new Hero("heroic")
alert(me.getType())

//passing anonymous function as parameter
ipcMain.on('test', (param1, param2)=>{
  // code block
})
```


## &raquo; React JSX TLDR

JSX is a templating feature of React.js which bundles a component's view code with the logic. The code between brackets is HTML to be rendered when the component is displayed in a web browser. Inside the HTML everything between curly brackets will be evaluated as JavaScript:

```JS
class App extends React.Component {
   constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.setState({name: "World!"})
   }
  
   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            <h1>App Header</h1>
            <strong>Hello {this.state.name}</strong>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
```
